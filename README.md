## Description
Workout Tracker is an application where users can track their workouts, and create new workouts as well. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout they've done for that day with functionality for different types of exercises, different amounts of reps/sets, weight amounts, duration of the exercise, or distance traveled for cardio. Users can also view their dashboard, which shows their workout information graphed over time. Built with a MongoDB database, Node.js and Express server in Javascript.
